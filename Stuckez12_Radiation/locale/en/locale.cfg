[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
Stuckez12-uranium-patch-walk-over=Welcome to Stuckez12 Radiation Mod.\nThis mod adds in radiation as an environmental hazard you now need to deal with.\n\nUranium is not as safe as it used to be so watch your step when travelling the world soon to be paved.
Stuckez12-radiation-entity-list=Nothing is safe from emitting radiation. [entity=transport-belt], [entity=assembling-machine-1], [entity=chemical-plant], [entity=centrifuge], [entity=nuclear-reactor] even [entity=construction-robot] and [entity=spidertron] is safe no more. If it can hold radioactive items, it will emit radiation. Even YOU.
Stuckez12-radiation-distance-impact=Radiation becomes stronger the closer you are to it's source.\nYour best bet is to stay as far away from all radiation if you want to survive.\nRadiation becomes more powerful with the concentration of radioactive items, so no more chests full of uranium unless you're on the other side of the map.
Stuckez12-radiation-resistance=[item=radiation-absorption-equipment] and [item=radiation-reduction-equipment] are your first line of defence to combatting radiation.\nThey are essential when handling more intense radioactive items.\n\n[item=radiation-absorption-equipment] absorbes 10 radiation damage and [item=radiation-reduction-equipment] reduces damage by 20% with even higher tiers absorbing/reducing even more radiation.
Stuckez12-radiation-walls=[entity=radiation-wall] can prevent 200 radiation damage when placed between the player and any radiated entity.\nIncorporate them into your uranium design and have a fighting chance against your kovarex setup.\n\nDisclaimer: Filling up a [item=steel-chest] with ready to use [item=uranium-fuel-cell] and surrounding it with a 4-layer thick radiation wall can (and will) potentially kill you. It is recommended not to do this. You have been advised.
Stuckez12-radiation-suit=[item=radiation-suit] is your final line of defense, outperforming all radiation resistance equipment solo. When combining all forms of resistance together, not even the highest dose of radiation can stop you.\n\nOrder of mitigating radiation damage is as follows: First [item=radiation-reduction-equipment] then [item=radiation-absorption-equipment] and finally [item=radiation-suit].\n\nAbove example compares the [item=radiation-suit] against 2 [item=radiation-reduction-equipment] and 2 [item=radiation-absorption-equipment] combined.
Stuckez12-radiation-biters=With the rise of pollution and your expansion in production, the biters have evolved with the power of [item=uranium-ore] to emit radiation.\n\nEnemies including [entity=big-biter], [entity=big-spitter], [entity=behemoth-biter] and [entity=behemoth-spitter] emit constant radiation whilst existing making it harder to expand and conquer the world.\nBut beware when killing them as their corpses will still emit radiation although not as powerful.
