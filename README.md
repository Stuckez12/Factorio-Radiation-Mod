Is uranium not a big enough threat for your liking? Tired of feeling too safe within your own factory? Want to add some spicy new hazards to your current and future factories?

Well, look no further than Stuckez12's Radiation mod!

# What does this mod provide?
Once installed, all uranium items become a natural hazard to you, the player, slowing down the expansion of your factory.
Nowhere is safe from them.

- Uranium in centrifuges? Irradiated.
- Nuclear fuel cells? Irradiated.
- A chest packed with atomic bombs? IRRADIATED.

No entity is safe - radiation from any source can harm YOU, the player.

# How to fight back?
Oh, you want to co-exist with the radiation? Too bad - it won’t be so kind as to stop corroding your life away.

With the new absorption and reduction equipment, you can fight back radiation and become IMMUNE to its endless power.
With three tiers of each piece of equipment, you get to decide how powerless radiation will become against you.

And to top it all off, you can craft your very own radiation suit, perfect for any highly irradiated zones in your factory.

Also, with the advancement of the engineer’s intellect, you can build walls resistant to radiation to further weaken its power.

# 12-tile distance is NOTHING!
If you’re storing a steel chest full of uranium fuel cells, you better be a god capable of controlling radiation.
Their power can reach you from up to 32 CHUNKS away.

No more can the engineer stockpile ungodly amounts of radioactive items without zoning off parts of the factory as uninhabitable.

Radiation-resistant walls? Forget about it. Nothing stops radiation from its undisturbed inventory source.

# What about the biters?
Yes, biters are affected too—but not in the way you want.

After your declaration of genocide, they took a small bite of uranium and, through their evolution, will become mobile tanks spewing their acid, fangs, and radiation in your direction.

# But I want to play my way!
No worries - you can customize the behavior and reach of radiation to your heart’s content (within reason).

Don’t like chests being able to kill you from the other side of the planet? You can reduce or disable chunk-based radiation at any time.
Dislike the biters tickling you with their radiation. You can also disable their new evolution feature.

# Can I add this to my current playthrough?
Yes, you can add this to your current playthrough. The mod was designed as a standalone addition that can be dropped in anywhere.

Running the '/chest_migrate' command will fetch all chests on every surface you’ve visited and add them to the mod’s internal memory, ready to cause chaos. 
Warning: Depending on the size of your save, it will briefly lag your game while it scans every chunk.
